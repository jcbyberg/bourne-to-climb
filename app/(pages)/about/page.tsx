            <p>
              Dustin started in tree work over a decade ago, learning rope rigging,
              crane removals, and arborist best practices across the GTA. In 2013,
              he launched Bourne To Climb to bring that expertise back home to
              Durham Region with a focus on hometown service.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every job begins with a walk-around and honest conversation. We
              explain the plan, set expectations for access and cleanup, and work
              courteously around neighbours, pets, and gardens. When the job is
              complete, we rake, blow, and leave the space ready to enjoy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whether it’s a tight removal over a pool, a hedge restoration, or a
              middle-of-the-night storm response, Dustin leads the crew with the
              right equipment, detailed planning, and a commitment to safety.
